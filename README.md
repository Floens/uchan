µchan is a modern take on internet messaging board software. µchan is in beta.

It currently has all the basic features you need: boards for different topics, support for attaching images to posts and a system for moderating. µchan is anonymous and requires no account to post.

## Who is µchan for?
You can use µchan to set up your own message board website. See the [setup](SETUP) guide for more info.
The goal of µchan is to be the go-to software for messaging board software.

## Why should I use µchan?
This software is meant to replace older solutions that aren't of this age anymore. Traditional messaging boards are static: each time a user submits a message it generates new files to update the board. Changing layouts and the likes requires full rebuilds of the site.

µchan takes a dynamic approach, and generates pages when they are requested. On top of that is a good caching mechanism, so that responses are delivered just as fast as static files.
